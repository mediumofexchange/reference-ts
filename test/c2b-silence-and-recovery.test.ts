// §C2b: "When sequencers go dark, claims go illiquid rather than dead... after
// the declared silence, redemption against the last witnessed snapshot opens
// without co-signature, with the holder proving the claim unspent as of that
// snapshot."
//
// This slice builds the two facts that open it, and stops there; the payment
// path (the claim/acceptance/release legs and the challenge window) is the next
// slice. The facts are worth having on their own: both are checkable by any
// stranger against the published record, which is what makes the grade
// something a backer concedes rather than argues.
//
//   - the grade. "No commitment past a second declared duration, in any
//     setting: the aggravated grade." The duration is declared in E, so the
//     holder read the choice before accepting (invariant 1: no edit).
//   - the unspentness proof. Invariant 23 says "the spent set must support
//     non-membership proofs, since §C2b's recovery path proves a claim not
//     spent as of the last commitment, which a bare Merkle root cannot do."
//     Under transparent the whole served state is rehashed against the root —
//     the same way a receipt proves — so serving everything IS the proof, and
//     the Merkle machinery belongs with the constructions that cannot serve
//     everything. See DECISIONS.md.
