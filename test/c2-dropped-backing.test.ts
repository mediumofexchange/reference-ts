// **An operator that drops one backing from its committed state.**
//
// §C2 has a shared operator batching: "The fee is per backing per interval,
// which forces batching. A shared operator publishes one transaction over a root
// of its backings' commitments." So a commitment omitting one backing is not a
// commitment FOR that backing — and a stranger reading the venue sees only a
// root, so it cannot tell.
//
// Slice 11 found the hole and recorded it; slices 13 and 14 both re-flagged it
// and deferred. What nobody had run was the whole of it, and it is worse than
// recorded: the aggravated grade is blind (the operator publishes), the rewrite
// fault is silent (the log did not shrink, it vanished), a receipt reads
// "unrelated", and no holding proves. The non-service grade DOES fire — but only
// against the last state that carried the backing — and the remedy it opens,
// §C2's replacement rule, could not be taken: takeOver refused the incumbent's
// latest (no log for the backing) and refused the last state carrying it (not
// the incumbent's latest). The grade fired, named the remedy, and the remedy
// could not be executed.
//
// The cause is one layer down. committedLogFor asks three questions that always
// travel together and merged two different answers into one `undefined`: "this
// is not your operator's state", and "this IS your operator's state, and it
// carries no log for your backing". The second is the accusation, reported as
// the first, and every caller inherited the blindness.
