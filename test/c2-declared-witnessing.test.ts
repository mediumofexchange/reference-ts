// §C2: "At the declared interval each publishes a small commitment to a widely
// witnessed venue... Venue and attester are named in E and move only under its
// replacement rule." And the glossary's own field list has E declaring "who
// currently attests a claim unspent, the venue it commits to, **the witness
// interval**, the replacement rule, the claim-layer setting and its
// construction... and the silence clause".
//
// Ours declared the operator key and the silence clause, and neither of the
// other two. That cost two different things.
//
//   - **The venue.** §C2b makes a grade effective "for each backing at its
//     witnessed index on that backing's declared venue", and the whole reason a
//     grade works is that it is a fact a stranger checks against the published
//     record — something a backer concedes rather than argues. Measured against
//     whichever venue the caller happened to pass, it is a fact about who you
//     asked: two holders with two venues get two grades for one backing and
//     neither is wrong. That is a soundness gap, not a missing convenience.
//   - **The interval.** §C2: "Short intervals cost fees, long ones cost
//     exposure, and there is no third option, which is why the interval is a
//     signed field rather than operational discretion." A payment is final when
//     witnessed rather than co-signed (CLAUDE.md, and §C2's own "Finality means
//     witnessed rather than co-signed"), so a payee waiting for the next
//     commitment needs to know how long that is. Without it they can measure
//     how stale the last commitment is and cannot tell a fast operator running
//     late from a slow one running on time.
//
// Both go inside the name, so neither is the operator's to edit (invariant 1),
// and both are optional in the same way the silence clause is: a backing that
// declares no venue is graded against whichever record you hold, which is the
// backer's choice and the holder's to read before accepting.
//
// The finality rule §C2 pairs a venue with — "the depth or gadget under which an
// index counts as witnessed there" — is NOT declared here. This Venue has
// immediate finality and says so, so the rule has nothing to say yet, and a tag
// carries only what this slice enforces (the tag-0x02 rule). The venue is an
// opaque 32-byte identity for the same reason the operator key was one in slice
// 1: E names it, the code checks it matches, and what it MEANS is elsewhere.
