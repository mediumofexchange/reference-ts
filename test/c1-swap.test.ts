// §C1's swap: "The n-party atomic exchange is first-class, and the paper quietly
// needs it: bilateral netting (a gift if either burns first), clearing a cycle,
// set-for-set reassembly trades, atomic multi-hop routing. It is presentation's
// machinery. Every participant locks what it gives, all sign, commit converts
// every lock at once, any refusal to prepare aborts, and the timeout unlocks
// everywhere. The fully signed exchange object is the release, publishable by
// any participant, and read against the same timeout predicate."
//
// 24b's bundle is the one-party case: the holder locks, the holder commits. Here
// each lock names its PARTIES — the keys whose signatures on the commit convert
// it — and one object carries every signature. A sequencer still matches one
// object against its own lock and knows nothing else; what it reads off the lock
// is who must have signed. A partial object therefore settles nothing anywhere,
// which is the whole of what "all sign" buys. Provided every lock in the exchange
// names the full set — which each party checks in the others' locks before it
// signs, exactly as a receiver checks every half is reserved (24b): the
// protocol cannot stop a party naming fewer, only make that party's own lock
// the one that settles on fewer signatures.
