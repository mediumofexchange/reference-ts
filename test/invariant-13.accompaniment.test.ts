// The gap slice 22 pinned as OPEN, and the party it costs.
//
// Invariant 13 says a holding is presentable at *b* for *q* only with *q·cᵢ*
// units of each leg. Slice 22 enforces that when the demand is filed — but the
// law is per backing, so a served log carrying a demand whose legs were never
// locked replays perfectly well, and stateIsAuthentic, which folds one backing,
// says yes.
//
// The party who loses by it is the backer: it would answer a demand and take in
// a claim it cannot unwind. And the backer signs the acceptance, so it is the
// one who can check first — which is what this is for. It reads across the
// served state, where every backing the operator serves already is, plus the
// legs' own terms, which are hashes in R and so need a resolver (§C0b: published
// means retrievable).
//
// Three answers, not two, for the reason every predicate here has three:
// "I could not read the legs" must not come back as "the backer took in a set it
// cannot unwind".
