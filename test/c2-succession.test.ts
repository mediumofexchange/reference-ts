// §C2, succession: "A replacement is itself a witnessed object. It is signed by
// whoever E's rule names, the backer by default, states the role, the successor
// and the effective index... Each replacement names its predecessor, so the
// chain from the original terms is walkable. Its effective index is no earlier
// than the index at which it is itself witnessed, and it takes effect only from
// the first index at which it has published its own commitment... Until then the
// predecessor's last commitment governs... From the effective index the old
// attester's co-signatures stop counting, which is why a wallet verifies the
// chain rather than the key it remembers."
//
// E's operator sits inside the name and invariant 1 forbids an edit, so a
// replacement does not change it — it supersedes it on a record anyone can walk.
// That is how the venue and the operator "move only under its replacement rule"
// while both stay inside the hash.
//
// **What this slice does NOT do:** let the successor serve. Registering,
// co-signing and adopting the predecessor's log are the successor's side of the
// handover, and they need the tail the predecessor left. The chain is declared,
// walkable, and read by the verifiers that ask who is in force; Sequencer still
// serves only the key E names. See DECISIONS.md.
