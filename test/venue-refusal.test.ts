// **A venue that declines to answer is never a verdict.**
//
// A real venue holds a partial view. ErgoVenue syncs for named backings and
// refuses anything else, because absence of data must not read as a fact: a
// backing it never fetched has no commitments, and no commitments reads as
// silence since genesis. That guard is slice 17's, and it is only worth having
// if it survives the readers above it.
//
// It kept not surviving. Slice 19 found revokedAt turning the refusal into
// "not revoked" — a clean bill of health for a stolen key — and then found
// successionOf turning it into the GENESIS chain, so a replaced operator read as
// still in force and a punctual successor graded silent. Fixing those two moved
// the swallow one layer up rather than removing it: isAnOperator caught it next
// and answered false, so an honest operator's real committed state read as
// inauthentic and every receipt against it read "unrelated".
//
// The rule is one line — a VenueError is a refusal, not malformed input — and
// what this file does is hold every verifier that takes a Venue to it, in one
// list, so that a reader can see the whole surface and a new verifier that
// forgets is a failing test rather than a discovery three slices later.
