// Invariant 16, and §8b's own worked example.
//
//   "The full chain under a requirement is its **closure**. Closures are written
//   with a `closure(S)` macro, expanded before hashing, and counts add up where
//   paths meet. If *b* relies on *x* and *y*, and each of those relies on *z* at
//   1, then closure({x:1, y:1}) = {x:1, y:1, z:2}. Two units of *z*, because
//   presenting at *x* alone would leave *y* without the *z* it needs.
//   Multiplicities grow like a matrix power, so wallets cap closure size."
//
// **A macro for writing terms, not a rule about them.** §8b: "Anyone can compute
// closed(b), whether R(b) equals its own closure. **An unclosed requirement is
// readable**: the backer takes in a set it cannot fully unwind, usually because
// it means to sell it." So an unclosed R is a legal setting, and makeBacking
// stores what it is given. What "expanded before hashing" means is that a backer
// who writes `closure(S)` gets the flat expansion into the terms, and the name
// commits to that — never that some later reader re-expands what was written.
// Existing names are untouched.
//
// **Expansion needs the targets' own terms**, which are hashes here, so it takes
// a resolver — §C0b's "published means retrievable by a stranger... terms, logs,
// totals" is what makes one available. The resolver is the untrusted part: it is
// asked for a name and could hand back anything, so every answer is checked
// against the name that was asked for. That check is also what makes the walk
// terminate, and it is why invariant 5 still holds — "do not write cycle
// detection... a reliance cycle would need a hash cycle; it cannot be built".
// With the name checked, a cycle would need one, so there is none to detect.
