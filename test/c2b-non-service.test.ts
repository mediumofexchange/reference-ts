// §C2b's other grade, and the one that reaches the party the aggravated grade
// cannot: "The clause is measured on service rather than publication. A stalling
// backer-run sequencer publishes on time, and the stall shows only as a spent
// set that stops growing."
//
//   "**Non-service**: a signed transfer request, published where demands are,
//   left unserved past the declared duration and counted only while still
//   unserved... It fires in the aggregate, and E declares the aggregate: at
//   least m distinct requests, each unserved past the duration, standing within
//   a window W."
//
// The remedy is E's replacement rule, which slice 13 built — so this grade
// finally has somewhere to point. And it is the answer to the hole slice 11
// recorded: an operator that drops a backing from its commitments keeps
// publishing and reads as perfectly live, and this is the grade that counts what
// it stopped doing.
