// Invariant 8: "No clawback, no reversal, no privileged party who can move
// claims... this one forbids the path existing at all." Slices 2-6 forbade it in
// the ledger. It was still open in *served state*: an operator could commit a
// state in which it held everything, and nothing checked that the balances
// followed from the log or that the log followed from anybody's signature.
//
// Two attacks, both demonstrated before this slice:
//   - the sweep. Balances reassigned to the operator. Conservation passes,
//     because nothing was destroyed, and every holder is locked out.
//   - the fabricated append. Transfers nobody signed, appended to the log so
//     that the fold agrees with the swept balances. Earlier receipts still
//     prove, because their positions did not move.
//
// So a served state now has to survive three questions at once (invariants 8,
// 22, 23): is it what the operator committed to, do its balances follow from its
// own log, and was every operation in that log authorised by the party the law
// requires? The signature is served rather than committed — the entry's
// canonical message is already committed and only the true signer can sign it,
// which is invariant 23's own arrangement: the commitment "does not contain any
// of them, and anything checked against them has to be served".
