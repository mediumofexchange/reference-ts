// What can be proven, against whom, without trusting anybody.
//
// The system's posture everywhere is that misbehaviour is made PROVABLE rather
// than prevented: invariant 22 makes two roots at one sequence an operator's
// provable fault, §C2b grades silence on facts a stranger can check, and §C3
// makes dishonour "publicly checkable... with nobody reporting anything". That
// posture had a hole: it covered the operator and never the holder.
//
// §C2b's challenge window is where it bites. A claimant who has signed her
// holding away and then redeems the stale snapshot has signed TWO operations at
// one point in her own nonce sequence, and the protocol cannot tell which one
// her dark operator accepted — so it cannot always pay the right party. What it
// can do is name the fault, and these are the predicates that do it:
//
//   - a signer authorised two operations at one nonce (the holder's fault)
//   - an operator co-signed both halves of that (the operator's fault, which is
//     the backer's under the backer-run default)
//   - an operator co-signed two operations into one log position
//
// The last two also catch a botched failover, where two live servers hold one
// operator key: the protocol cannot distinguish that from malice, and treats it
// the same way it treats a self-framing commitment equivocation.
//
// Every one is a verifier over adversary-supplied bytes, so none of them throws.
