// Invariant 13's other half, and the first presentation that moves a leg.
//
//   "A holding is presentable at *b* for *q* if and only if it contains *q*
//   units of *b* and *q·cᵢ* units of each *(bᵢ, cᵢ)* in R(b)."
//
// §C3 licenses doing it in one act here: "Single-phase wherever every lock in
// the set can be taken in one atomically signed decision: R empty and the payout
// settling outside the claim layer, **or the whole set and the paying leg inside
// one operator**." So this operator takes the demand and every lock together, or
// refuses the lot. Two-phase — a decision venue and a lock timeout — is what a
// set spanning operators needs, and is not built.
//
// **A leg is reserved in the leg's own log**, signed by the holder whose units
// it commits, because those units are that backing's and every backing has to
// stay replayable on its own — which provesHolding, the redemption walk and
// committedOutstanding all rest on. Deriving the leg locks from the demand plus
// R(b) instead would mean no backing could be checked alone.
//
// **The beneficiary is the DEMANDED backing's obligor**, not the leg's: the
// backer of *b* takes in the whole set and may then present at *bᵢ* itself,
// which is what reliance is for. Signed into the lock rather than supplied at
// release, or the operator would choose where the accompaniment goes.
