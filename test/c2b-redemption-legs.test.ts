// §C2b's payment path: the claim, acceptance and release legs, the challenge
// window, and a returning sequencer adopting what was witnessed during the gap.
//
//   "Snapshot redemption publishes the claim's nullifier at the witness venue
//   as the release leg, after the backer's acceptance, and a sequencer
//   returning from silence adopts every nullifier witnessed during the gap
//   before co-signing again. A snapshot redemption also stands for a declared
//   challenge window, during which anyone may publish at the venue the
//   holder-signed transfer request that spent the named claim. On publication
//   the redemption pays the request's presenter instead... Under transparent, a
//   signed spend record published at the venue, checked against the last
//   committed balance state, stands in for the nullifier."
//
// So redemption is not a second protocol. It is §C3's demand-accept-release
// with the legs published at the venue instead of submitted to the dark
// sequencer, and under transparent a signed spend record IS an operation-log
// entry. One law, one replay, one nonce sequence: the legs are ordinary
// operations, applied through the same applyEntry, and adoption is appending
// them in the order the venue witnessed them.
//
// The clock every leg is judged against is the index the VENUE stamped it with
// — the venue's word, never the operator's — so no leg needs an operator to
// assert when it happened. See DECISIONS.md.
