// Invariant 21 and §C2: the witnessed clock belongs to the venue, not to any
// operator. "A venue is named together with its finality rule, the depth or
// gadget under which an index counts as witnessed there" — a widely witnessed
// venue, typically a public chain, whose indices advance whether or not any
// particular operator publishes.
//
// Two different indices, deliberately named differently in the code so they
// cannot be conflated again:
//   - a commitment's `sequence` is the operator's own count of its commitments.
//     Equivocation is two different roots signed at one sequence number.
//   - the venue's witnessed index is the clock every deadline is read against.
//
// Read as one, an operator that simply stops publishing freezes every deadline
// in its book: no dishonour is ever reached, and a holder locked by a live
// acceptance can never withdraw. §C2b names that party — "A stalling backer-run
// sequencer publishes on time, and the stall shows only as a spent set that
// stops growing" — and §C2 the reason it matters: "a stall is deniable where a
// dishonour is recorded." Presentation already refuses that trap when it comes
// as a signature; these tests refuse it when it comes as silence.
