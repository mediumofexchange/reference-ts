// §C2b's first paragraph, and the one failure branch that had no implementation.
//
//   "If a backer's key is stolen, the damage is unbounded and permanent, since K
//   alone authorises issuance and nothing expires. So K may publish a
//   revocation: witnessed, and prospective, so existing claims keep their terms
//   and no further issuance is valid."
//
//   "It is per venue, and effective for each backing at its witnessed index on
//   that backing's declared venue, published by K to every venue its backings
//   name. The boundary is the index rather than the signing clock, so issuance
//   witnessed before the revocation stands, anything witnessed after is void,
//   and a thief's unwitnessed batch dies with it."
//
// **It is a stop-loss, not a remedy.** A thief issues fast and a backer notices
// slowly, so by the time the revocation is witnessed the fraudulent supply is
// already committed and stands. The paper says so: "the damage is unbounded and
// permanent", and "a thief's purpose is to issue, so it revokes only on the way
// out". What prevention looks like is a threshold K — §C2b: "That is the
// strongest argument for a threshold K" — which is invisible here, since t-of-n
// aggregated to one Ed25519 key leaves the name, E and strict verification
// untouched. The same shape as CLAUDE.md's one-writer rule for the operator.
//
// **Where the boundary lives.** An issuance is witnessed when a commitment
// carrying it is witnessed, and a log entry records no index of its own — so the
// rule is read between two committed states rather than per entry: once the
// revocation is witnessed at R, the outstanding that stands is the one in the
// last commitment witnessed strictly before R.
//
// **What is NOT done, and it is the whole of decision 3.** Nothing is unwound
// and no holder is told their units are void. Which units descend from a void
// issuance is provenance, ruled out in CLAUDE.md rather than deferred, and
// impossible under blinding anyway. So the code publishes ONE number about the
// BACKING — how far its committed supply exceeds what stands — and never a
// verdict about anyone's holding. Allocation was settled in P before anyone
// accepted (§18: "the excluded ingredient is discretion after the fact"), and
// invariant 19 forbids a payout that reads holder identity at all.
