// Ergo read as a witness venue. The chain witnesses and adjudicates nothing, so
// there is no contract here and nothing verifies a signature on-chain — a
// commitment is a record in box registers and every judgement is the reader's.
//
// Two properties carry the security of it, and both are tested below:
//
//   - **the witnessed index is the box's inclusionHeight**, which is the block
//     that included the creating transaction. A box's own creationHeight is
//     written by whoever built the transaction and may be set lower, so using it
//     would let an operator backdate a commitment to before a redemption leg it
//     actually followed — the veto slice 8 closed. It is not even modelled here.
//   - **nothing inside the finality depth is read at all**, because
//     inclusionHeight is reorg-sensitive and a venue answering from the tip would
//     change its mind about the past.
//
// And the seam is only real if the existing predicates accept it, so the last
// group runs them against this venue rather than the local one.
