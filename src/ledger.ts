// The transparent claim layer (§C1): a per-backing public ledger of
// key-controlled balances, transfer by holder signature.
//
// The law, enforced structurally:
//   - nothing you owe grows without your signature: only `issue`, verified
//     against the registered backing's obligor key, raises the outstanding
//     count;
//   - nothing you hold leaves without your signature: `transfer` and `burn`
//     verify against the holding key itself. No other mutation path exists
//     (invariant 8) — there is deliberately no method that takes an operator's
//     or backer's authority over someone else's balance, and every accessor
//     returns a copy so a caller cannot reach in and mutate state. The one
//     method that shrinks a log, `restore`, shrinks it to the mark the
//     sequencer set at its last commitment and never below it (§C2b's return
//     from silence); what it drops is co-signed and unwitnessed, and a mark set
//     anywhere but at a commitment is isRewrittenHistory's to catch.
//
// Conservation (invariant 10): outstanding = issued − burned, per backing,
// after every operation, and the sum of balances equals outstanding.
// Redemption is not a ledger concept: settling a demand moves the claims to the
// backer, who is then simply their holder, and only an explicit burn lowers the
// count.
//
// Every logged operation carries the signature that authorised it, so a served
// state can be checked for authenticity and not only for consistency (oplog.ts).
// The signature is stored beside the entry, not inside its canonical bytes.
//
// Every operation is atomic: all checks run before any mutation, so it either
// fully applies or throws with no state change. Every operation — the three that
// move value, the four of presentation and the two of an atomic attempt —
// appends exactly one entry to the operation log, and every one but the commit
// consumes exactly one nonce (CLAUDE.md names that departure), both in `apply`,
// so there is one place where an operation becomes a fact. A signer's nonce is per
// (signer, backing).
//
// Operations whose outcome depends on time take the witnessed index they are
// judged against as an argument. Invariant 21 forbids a time a party asserts
// alone, so the ledger never reads a clock: the sequencer supplies the venue's
// latest index for an operation submitted to it, and the index the venue
// stamped a publication with for one adopted out of a §C2b gap.
//
// NOTE (later slices, see DECISIONS.md): op-log positions are the ledger's own
// per-backing append indices, which are the log's own bookkeeping and not a
// clock — the venue's witnessed index is that (venue.ts). The state below is
// the fold of the log and nothing else, kept incrementally here and replayed
// from scratch by a verifier through the same applyEntry. There are no
// commitments over it in this file; the sequencer adds those.
