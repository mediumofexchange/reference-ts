// Succession (§C2): who serves a backing, once the key E names no longer does.
//
// "**A replacement is itself a witnessed object.** It is signed by whoever
// **E**'s rule names, the backer by default, states the role, the successor and
// the effective index, and is published always at the successor venue and at the
// old one while it serves. Each replacement names its predecessor, so the chain
// from the original terms is walkable. Its effective index is no earlier than
// the index at which it is itself witnessed, and it takes effect only from the
// first index at which it has published its own commitment over a spent set it
// serves in full. Until then the predecessor's last commitment governs, no new
// co-signatures issue, and accrual against the incumbent continues... From the
// effective index the old attester's co-signatures stop counting, which is why a
// wallet verifies the chain rather than the key it remembers."
//
// **E's operator is the genesis value, not a mutable field.** It sits inside the
// name and invariant 1 forbids an edit, so a replacement does not change it — it
// supersedes it, on a record anyone can walk. That is what makes "the chain from
// the original terms is walkable" the literal mechanism rather than a metaphor,
// and it is why the venue and the operator can "move only under its replacement
// rule" while both stay inside the hash.
//
// The chain is **hash-linked**: each replacement names its predecessor by the
// hash of that predecessor's own canonical message, and the first link names the
// backing itself. A fork cannot be spliced in unseen, and walking backwards from
// any link reaches the original terms or nothing.
//
// Canonical message, signed by the key E's replacement clause names:
//
//   context "mfp/replacement/v1"
//     || 32-byte backing name
//     || u8 role (0x01 operator)
//     || 32-byte successor
//     || 32-byte predecessor (the backing name at the first link)
//     || u64 effective index
//
// **One role is defined, and the field is still written.** Only the operator can
// be replaced here; the venue is the clock every deadline is read against, and
// moving it is a second clock, which is the conflation slice 5 removed. Writing
// the role anyway is what stops a replacement of the operator being read later
// as a replacement of something else.
//
// Everything below is a verifier: the bytes come from whoever publishes them.

 * witnessed, so it is at least one the successor could have made for this
