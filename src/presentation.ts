// Presentation and dishonour (§C3): the signed messages.
//
// Consent between the parties is demand–accept–release. This slice implements
// the single-phase case, which §C3 licenses "wherever every lock in the set can
// be taken in one atomically signed decision: R empty and the payout settling
// outside the claim layer" — one sequencer, and the backer paying in something
// the claim layer does not carry. Prepare–decide–commit (atomicity across
// sequencers) is a later slice; see DECISIONS.md.
//
// Four messages, each domain-separated (contexts.ts) and framed (bytes.ts):
//
//   demand      context || backing name (32) || holder key (32)
//               || u32 length || quantity || u64 instant || u64 deadline
//               || u64 nonce
//   acceptance  context || backing name (32) || demand hash (32)
//               || u64 instant || u64 deadline || u64 nonce
//   release     context || backing name (32) || demand hash (32) || u64 nonce
//   withdrawal  context || backing name (32) || demand hash (32) || u64 nonce
//
// A demand is identified by the hash of its own canonical encoding, so an
// acceptance, a release and a withdrawal each name one exact demand — the
// "specific claims" §C3 requires, expressed as a commitment to the whole
// demand rather than to a quantity that two demands could share.
//
// As in messages.ts, the field-level encoders take the backing NAME rather than
// the Backing object, so a verifier holding only a committed operation-log
// entry can reconstruct the exact signed message and hence its hash (oplog.ts).
// The op-shaped wrappers below feed them backing.name.
//
// Instants and deadlines are witnessed indices — the operator's commitment
// index at the venue — never wall-clock time (§C0b, invariant 21). The
// acceptance repeats the instant so that agreeing it takes two signatures over
// one value (invariant 24).
