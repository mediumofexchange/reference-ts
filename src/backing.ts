// blocks are a canonical list instead: sorted, duplicate-free, and refused where
// a shorter tag says the same thing. Tags 0x02-0x04 were that enumeration for
// two blocks and are gone; recycling their numbers is how an old decoder reads
// new bytes as something else, so the list is 0x05. Tag 0x01 is untouched, and
// the slice-1 golden vector with it.
//
// A clause payload is deliberately NOT length-prefixed. A reader that could skip
// a clause it does not understand would report terms it cannot check, which is
// worse than declaring nothing — so an unknown clause tag is refused, exactly as
// an unknown evidence tag is.
//
// Tags not listed (threshold obligors, the payout expression language,
// chain-asset reliance targets, shielded evidence settings) are future slices;
// a strict decoder rejects them today rather than guessing.
