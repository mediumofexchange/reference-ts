// §C2b's first failure branch: the backer's key is stolen.
//
// "If a backer's key is stolen, the damage is unbounded and permanent, since K
// alone authorises issuance and nothing expires. So K may publish a revocation:
// witnessed, and prospective, so existing claims keep their terms and no further
// issuance is valid."
//
// **A stop-loss, not a remedy.** A thief issues fast and a backer notices
// slowly, so by the time a revocation is witnessed the fraudulent supply is
// already committed and stands — "the damage is unbounded and permanent", and "a
// thief's purpose is to issue, so it revokes only on the way out". What actually
// prevents the loss is a threshold K, which §C2b calls "the strongest argument"
// for one, and which is invisible here: t-of-n aggregated to a single Ed25519
// key leaves the name, E and strict verification untouched. That is the same
// shape as docs/PROTOCOL_RULES.md's one-writer rule for the operator, one role along.
//
// **It revokes a KEY, not a backing**, which makes it the one venue record that
// does not name a backing. §C2b: "published by K to every venue its backings
// name" — one K obligates many backings, and revoking it revokes all of them at
// once. Slice 15's rule that every record names its own backing was written for
// records about a backing; this is a record about a key, so it names the key.
//
// **And it carries nothing else.** No sequence, because "revocation is the one
// act no later signature can repair" and there is no second one to order. No
// venue, because the paper wants it relayed everywhere and a copy at another
// venue is a copy anyone may make. No expiry, because "de-revocation would carry
// the same K". Two revocations by one key are byte-identical, which is what
// makes republishing harmless.
