// Ergo as a witness venue (§C2).
//
// The chain **witnesses, and adjudicates nothing**. No contract here verifies a
// signature; a commitment is a record in box registers, and everything that
// judges it — equivocation, the silence grade, the redemption walk — is done by
// whoever reads. That is why this needs no ErgoScript and no change of curve.
//
// **Reads are a materialised view, and that is structural rather than a
// workaround.** `Venue` is synchronous and every caller through recovery, fault
// and the sequencer is synchronous with it; making it async to accommodate HTTP
// would ripple through the codebase for nothing. So this syncs asynchronously
// and answers synchronously: fetch the record, then reason over it offline.
// §C0b says what that is — "Published means retrievable by a stranger...
// Content-addressed storage gives integrity, not availability" — a holder
// obtains the trail and the checking never touches the network again.
//
// The layout, and the one line of it that is a security property:
//
//   commitment box   R4 operator key (32) || R5 root (32)
//                    || R6 sequence (Long) || R7 signature (64)
//   publication box  R4 backing name (32, a scan key)
//                    || R5 the record bytes (authoritative)
//
// **The witnessed index is the box's `inclusionHeight`, never its
// `creationHeight`.** The latter is written by whoever builds the transaction:
// consensus stops it exceeding the including block's height, but it may be set
// LOWER. An operator backdating a commitment would put it before a redemption
// leg it actually followed, which is precisely the veto slice 8 closed — a
// publication is judged against the record as it stood strictly before its own
// index, and the tie must not go to the party watching the venue.
//
// **Every read is taken at `height − depth`**, because `inclusionHeight` is
// reorg-sensitive and a venue answering from the tip would change its mind about
// the past. The depth is not a client setting: §C2 names a venue "together with
// its finality rule... That is a floor under the interval, or two sequencers
// answer §C3's release predicate differently." So the venue's own id commits to
// it (see `ergoVenueId`), and naming the venue is agreeing the depth.
//
// Reading requires a node with `extraIndex` enabled, since the /blockchain
// routes exist only then. That is a real floor under "retrievable by a
// stranger", and it is said here rather than discovered later.
//
// NOT here, deliberately: publishing. Building and submitting a transaction
// needs an Ergo library, and this repository's dependencies are @noble/hashes
// and @noble/curves. A verifier never publishes — only an operator does — so the
// read surface is the whole of what a holder needs, and publication is injected
// by whoever has a wallet. See DECISIONS.md.
