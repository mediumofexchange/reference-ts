// §C2b: failure, silence, and recovery — the two facts that open snapshot
// redemption.
//
// "When sequencers go dark, claims go illiquid rather than dead. Value discounts
// until they return, and after the declared silence, redemption against the last
// witnessed snapshot opens without co-signature, with the holder proving the
// claim unspent as of that snapshot."
//
// Two things have to be true, and both are checkable by a stranger against the
// published record — which is what makes the grade something a backer concedes
// rather than argues:
//
//   1. **the grade.** "No commitment past a second declared duration, in any
//      setting: the aggravated grade. It opens snapshot redemption and runs from
//      the first missed commitment until commitments resume." Measured on the
//      venue's clock, never the silent party's own publications, and against the
//      duration the backing itself declares in E.
//   2. **the unspentness proof.** Invariant 23: "The spent set must support
//      non-membership proofs, since §C2b's recovery path proves a claim *not*
//      spent as of the last commitment, which a bare Merkle root cannot do."
//      §C2b names the transparent form: "a signed spend record published at the
//      venue, checked against the last committed balance state, stands in for
//      the nullifier."
//
// Under transparent the whole served state is rehashed against the root, which
// is already how a receipt proves, so **serving everything IS the
// non-membership proof** — the Merkle machinery is what a construction needs
// when it cannot serve everything, and belongs with the shielded ones. See
// DECISIONS.md.
//
// **The payment path is those legs, published somewhere else.** §C2b:
// "Snapshot redemption publishes the claim's nullifier at the witness venue as
// the release leg, after the backer's acceptance." So it is not a second
// protocol beside §C3's demand-accept-release; it is that protocol with the legs
// published at the venue because there is no sequencer to submit them to, and
// under transparent a signed spend record IS an operation-log entry. One law,
// one replay, one nonce sequence — the legs go through the same `applyEntry`,
// and a returning sequencer adopting them is appending them in the order the
// venue witnessed them.
//
// Two things follow, and neither needed a new rule:
//
//   - **a standing demand is continued, not blocked.** Where the holder already
//     filed at the sequencer, the claim leg has happened and only the answer and
//     the release are left, which is §C2b's sentence read literally. Where they
//     had not, the claim leg is an ordinary demand, and a demand needs SPENDABLE
//     units — held minus what open demands commit — so the same units cannot
//     back two claims. Blocking instead would have deadlocked the holder, since
//     ending a demand takes a withdrawal and a withdrawal takes a sequencer.
//   - **the clock is the venue's stamp.** Every leg is judged at the index the
//     venue witnessed it at, which is the venue's word rather than the
//     operator's, so no leg needs an index anybody asserts. See DECISIONS.md.
//
// Everything here is a verifier: it answers questions about state an untrusted
// operator served, so it returns false on any malformed input and never throws —
// with two exceptions: a venue's refusal propagates rather than being answered
// (CLAUDE.md, `answering`; witnessedCommitFor raises one for a record that is
// not the lock's venue), and quietFor refuses a malformed operator key, which
// is the reader's own validated object and never adversary bytes.

 *     is a leg and comes only with its set; one naming another venue is not
 *     watched here), its attempt is not already committed at the venue (the
 *     record itself answered that one), and its timeout is not spent — at its
 *     witnessing (the law's TIME rule, asked at the one index the operator was
 *     first handed it) NOR by the reading index, since a door with a live
 *     clock refuses an expired lock at every index in the counting band too,
 *     and a one-sided gate let m short-timeout locks fire the grade against an
 *     operator with no lawful move. Both venue-and-timeout exclusions are
 *     asked after the law's fold accepts the entry, so unsigned noise dies at
 *     the signature check and never reaches the venue. The refusal aggregate
 *     (m', W') is NOT this count: its object is a signed refusal to prepare,
 *     and prepare-decide-commit is an extension (see DECISIONS, slice 28).
 *   - **It is not in the committed log.** Served means served, and a request the
 *     operator took stops counting the moment it commits it.
 *   - **Its age is past the declared duration and inside the window W.** Below
 *     the duration it has not been left unserved yet; past the window it is no
 *     longer standing.
 *   - **The committed state could have served them.** "Faking a request means
 *     holding a real claim, so the count is checkable" - so they are put to the
 *     law against the state the operator actually committed, which is the test
 *     the challenge window needed when a request the snapshot could never have
 *     served counted as a spend.
 *
 * **Served as a sequence, not one at a time.** The paper's own case for m is one
 * holder: "one holder can split a holding into m claims and file as many
 * requests... no request is fake, though one holder can supply all m of them."
 * Under transparent those m requests occupy consecutive nonces, so tested
 * independently against the committed state every one after the first is refused
 * as ahead of the signer's next - and the clause could never fire for the
 * scenario it was written for. They are folded onto one working state in nonce
 * order instead, which is what "the operator could have served these" means: it
 * could have served them in the order they were signed.
 *
 * Chains across holders - Alice pays Bob, Bob spends onward, both unserved - are
 * out of scope here for the reason they are in the challenge window: "a spend by
 * the payee is a different signer's sequence".
 *
 * Distinct by the operation each request is, so republishing one is not two. Two
 * requests at one nonce are one holder equivocating, and the second finds its
 * nonce spent by the first, so the fold counts one without needing a rule.
 *
 * A verifier: the state comes from an operator with a motive and the venue from

 * the requests are folded onto a copy of the snapshot in the order the venue
 * witnessed them, and the redemption pays whoever ends up holding the units it

 *
 * That gives four properties without four rules. Two conflicting requests at one

 * second finds its nonce spent — witnessing pins order (§C2). A chain of the
 * claimant's own spends pays each payee in turn, rather than the first and
 * nobody else. A request for more than was claimed redirects only what the
 * redemption pays. And a demand already standing in the snapshot cannot be
 * challenged at all, because its units were locked and its nonce spent before
 * the darkness — the lock had already done this job.
 *
 * **It pays the payee named in the request, not whoever published it.** The
 * spec's words are "pays the request's presenter", and its next clause explains
 * why they are normally the same party ("the payee already holds that request").
 * Read literally, anyone who merely saw a holder-signed transfer could publish
 * it and take the payment from the party it was made out to. See DECISIONS.md.
 *
 * The window bounds it and nothing else does: a request is evidence rather than
 * an operation, so it is not gated on the gap the legs are gated on. §C2b gives
 * the redemption a DECLARED window, and cutting it short the moment the operator
 * returns would let a prompt return decide how long anyone has to object.
