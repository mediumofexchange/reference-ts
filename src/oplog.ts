// One backing's operation log: the entry shape, and the canonical bytes of an
// entry.
//
// Every accepted operation appends exactly one entry, and `position` is the
// per-backing append index — a stand-in for witnessed interval time (§C2). The
// log carries all nine operation kinds: the three that move value (issue,
// transfer, burn), the four of presentation (demand, acceptance, release,
// withdrawal) and the two of an atomic attempt (lock, commit). Presentation belongs here because a receipt binds an operation to
// its position in the committed log (receipt.ts), and an operation that moves no
// value still needs to be undeniable.
//
// The one property this file exists for: **an entry's canonical bytes ARE the
// bytes the party signed.** So a verifier holding only a committed log entry can
// reconstruct the exact signed message, hash it, and compare it with a receipt;
// and the commitment (commitment.ts) commits precisely the operation the receipt
// attests to, rather than a re-description of it that a second encoder might get
// wrong. Each entry therefore carries its signed fields and nothing else:
//
//   - a release names the demand it settles, not the balances it moves. The
//     quantity and the holder come from the demand's own entry, earlier in the
//     same append-only log, and the destination is the obligor named in the
//     backing's terms. Neither is the operator's to assert.
//   - the demand hash an acceptance, release or withdrawal names is recomputable
//     from that demand's entry, so nothing here rests on an operator's word.
//
// Beside the signed fields each entry carries the signature that authorised it.
// That signature is NOT part of the entry's canonical bytes and is not
// committed: the message it covers already is, and only the true signer can
// produce one over it. It is served, which is what lets a verifier establish
// that a committed log was authorised rather than invented.
//
// This module knows the shape of an entry and its bytes, and nothing about the
// law. What an entry does to a state, and when it is refused, is ledger.ts:
// applyEntry, which the ledger applies as operations arrive and a verifier
// folds a served log through.
