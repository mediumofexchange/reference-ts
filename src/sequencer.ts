// The transparent sequencer (§C2).
//
// A sequencer serves the backings whose E field names its operator key. It is
// the front door to the claim layer: clients submit signed operations, the
// sequencer drives the transparent ledger underneath, and returns an operator
// co-signed receipt bound to the operation's position in the committed log. At
// a declared interval it publishes a commitment over the state it serves.
//
// It never holds funds. Its added value in the transparent setting (where the
// ledger already prevents double-spends) is fourfold:
//   - witnessed order: a receipt binds an operation to its committed position;
//   - idempotent replay (invariant 26): the same operation resubmitted returns
//     the identical prior receipt, and a different operation at an
//     already-spent nonce is declined by the ledger's NonceError — the
//     sequencer "refuses a second spend by declining to sign";
//   - commitments (invariants 22, 23): periodic signed roots over served
//     state, so a third party can verify state without trusting the
//     operator's live word;
//   - a witnessed clock: presentation (§C3) turns on indices, and invariant 21
//     forbids a time a party asserts alone, so the index comes from the venue —
//     which advances whether or not this operator publishes, so a sequencer
//     cannot freeze a deadline by going quiet.
//
// One venue per sequencer, taken at construction. The spec names the venue in E
// beside the operator; E carries only the operator key here, so one venue for
// the operator is the honest simplification — and it means there is exactly one
// clock, where a venue passed per call could give two answers to one predicate.
//
// Boundaries, per the design rules: the sequencer owns routing (is this
// backing mine?) and the clock, and raises SequencerError; the ledger owns the
// law and funds and raises LedgerError/NonceError; malformed fields raise
// EncodingError from the encoder. No layer re-checks or relabels another's
// verdict.
//
// **Coming back from silence.** §C2b: "a sequencer returning from silence adopts
// every nullifier witnessed during the gap before co-signing again." Adoption is
// enforced structurally rather than by a flag: `submit` adopts before it applies
// anything, and `commit` before it snapshots, so there is no order of calls in
// which this operator co-signs while ignoring what the venue witnessed without
// it. Each adopted operation is judged at the index the VENUE stamped it with,
// so adoption is reproducible by anyone holding the same record — the sequencer
// asserts nothing about when.
//
// **Two ways to move value, and the parties pick per trade.** §C2: "Two honest
// answers, pick one. Extend §C3's prepare-decide-commit to any multi-sequencer
// transfer, at a round trip per payment. Or let payees accept partial-and-retry
// and price it, as card networks do." `submitTransfer` is the second — one
// sequencer, final on its co-signature, and what every trade with recourse
// wants. `submitLock` and `settle` are the first, for a bundle that must move
// entire or not at all.
//
// NOTE (later slices, see DECISIONS.md): dated instruments and the refusal
// aggregate (m', W') are out of scope.
