// The witnessing venue (§C2).
//
// The spec publishes commitments to "a widely-witnessed venue, typically a
// public chain", named in E together with a finality rule. A reference
// implementation has no chain, so this is an in-memory append-only log of
// commitments with an immediate finality rule — the honest stand-in, with a
// clean seam where a real venue (and its depth/gadget finality) plugs in
// later. See DECISIONS.md.
//
// **The venue owns the clock.** Its witnessed index is the one every deadline in
// the system is read against, and it advances whether or not any particular
// operator publishes — `advance` stands in for block production, which nobody
// inside the system controls. That independence is the point: read the clock off
// an operator's own commitments instead and a sequencer that simply stops
// publishing freezes every deadline in its book, so no dishonour is ever reached
// and a holder locked by a live acceptance can never withdraw. §C2b names that
// party: "A stalling backer-run sequencer publishes on time, and the stall shows
// only as a spent set that stops growing."
//
// So a commitment's `sequence` — the operator's own count of its commitments,
// which equivocation is keyed on — is a different number from the venue's
// witnessed index, and the two are named differently here so they cannot be
// read as one. The venue records both: what was published, and the index it was
// witnessed at, which is the only trustworthy source for the latter. Both are
// stored as the venue's own copies and handed out as copies — the publisher keeps
// a reference to what it published, and `readonly` does not stop it rewriting
// those bytes.
//
// **A venue has an identity, and E names it.** §C2b makes a grade effective
// "for each backing at its witnessed index on that backing's declared venue",
// so a reader asking whether an operator has gone silent has to be asking the
// right record. recovery.ts refuses to answer for a backing that names a
// different venue; a backing that names none is answered by whichever record
// its reader holds, which is the setting its backer chose.
//
// Anyone may publish, so every query is per operator: a stranger's commitments
// must not be mistaken for the operator you are checking. The venue does not
// judge equivocation; it records what was published, and isEquivocation
// (commitment.ts) is what proves a fault against the record.
//
// **The venue records two kinds of thing.** Commitments, which operators
// publish, and operations, which anyone may. §C2b sends the second here when a
// sequencer goes dark: "a signed spend record published at the venue, checked
// against the last committed balance state, stands in for the nullifier", and
// the transfer request a challenger exhibits is published "where demands are".
// The venue judges neither. It records what was published and the index it was
// witnessed at, exactly as it does for a commitment — whether an operation had
// any force is the law's question, answered by whoever reads (recovery.ts).
// Refusing bytes that do not encode is the one thing it does judge, because an
// entry with no canonical message is not a record of anything.

 *     state — the sequencer's walk cache is keyed on exactly that pair, and a
 *     view that re-gathers (ErgoVenue's sync) must only ever move it forward.
 *     A second reader leans on it harder: the walk's memo of admitted
 *     replacement records (`replacement.ts`) never judges a position below
 *     its count again, so a view that replaces its records says so
 *     (`forgetAdmitted`, which ErgoVenue's sync calls) or is out of contract.
 *   - **Witnessed order.** Records come out in the order they were witnessed:
 *     the walk's memo keeps a record's first POSITION as its first witnessing,
 *     which the walk's own sort used to normalise (the slice-37 verification).
 *   - **A declared lag, bound to the id.** `lag()` is a constant of the
 *     venue's finality rule — the least number of indices by which an act
 *     signed at its clock is witnessed after it — never a view's state, so it
 *     answers unsynced, and the id a backing declares must determine it, as
 *     `ergoVenueId` does; the index a view reports a record at is the same
 *     kind of word. The walk floors a replacement's lead on it (§C2,
 *     slice 38). Nothing here can check the number: a view declaring less
 *     than the venue lags reopens the erasure the floor closes, one declaring
 *     more holds a retired key in force, and two views answering one id with
 *     two lags put two honest readers permanently at odds about a past index
 *     (the slice-38 review's security angle, S6).
 *   - **Reads answer or throw `VenueError`.** A read that throws anything else
 *     is out of contract: verifiers wrap their bodies in `answering`, which
 *     converts a foreign throw into a false — and at a door a false is
 *     consent, which is the one direction a venue failure must never point.
