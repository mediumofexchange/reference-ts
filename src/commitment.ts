// Commitments over ledger state (invariants 22, 23).
//
// At each interval a sequencer publishes a commitment: a signed hash over the
// state it serves — per backing, its name and its full operation log, all seven
// kinds with presentation included. Invariant 22: every state a sequencer
// asserts must prove against its latest published commitment, so two
// commitments at one sequence number over different roots, both validly signed
// by the operator, are provable equivocation.
//
// **The log is all that is committed, because the log is all there is.**
// Invariant 23 asks the commitment to commit to "the issuance log, the spent
// set, running totals and the standing demand record"; under transparent the log
// determines every one of them, so committing it commits them all. Balances,
// totals and the standing demands were once committed beside it and re-derived
// by the verifier — three mechanisms for data one of them fixes, and the source
// of a run of "field X is not tied to the log" bugs, each patched separately.
// Deriving them instead does not check that class of lie; it makes it
// unsayable. Invariant 10 comes with it: every operation the replay applies
// either conserves the total or moves issued/burned with it, so
// `outstanding = issued − burned` is a property of the fold rather than an
// assertion to police.
//
// The root must be INJECTIVE or invariant 22 is worthless: if two different
// served states hash to one root, an operator equivocates with a single
// signature and no provable fault. Injectivity comes from the framing rule —
// every key and name goes through key32 (fixed width, asserted) and every
// variable-length field is length-prefixed. Writing keys raw is what breaks
// it: a 31-byte and a 33-byte key concatenate exactly like two 32-byte keys.
//
// The root is over the whole served state, which a verifier must be given to
// check (the spec's availability point: "somebody has to serve" the trail).
// That is also why invariant 23's per-element non-membership proofs are not
// here: under transparent the whole state is served and rehashed, so serving
// everything IS the proof. The Merkle machinery is what a construction needs
// when it cannot serve everything, which is the shielded ones — and, as reading
// Basis showed, any construction whose verifier is a CONTRACT rather than a
// person, since a contract cannot be served a log. Harmless while the venue only
// witnesses; it bites the moment a contract adjudicates. See DECISIONS.md.

 * commitment for it, and a stranger reading a root cannot tell).
 *
 * `dropped` is a description of the state, never an accusation. A commitment made
