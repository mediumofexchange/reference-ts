// What can be proven, against whom, on one screen.
//
// The system's posture everywhere is that misbehaviour is made **provable**
// rather than prevented. Invariant 22 makes two roots signed at one sequence an
// operator's provable fault (`isEquivocation`, commitment.ts). §C2b grades
// silence on facts a stranger checks against the published record. §C3 makes
// dishonour "publicly checkable... with nobody reporting anything". Nothing here
// stops a party misbehaving; it makes the misbehaviour undeniable afterwards,
// and §15 prices the key's history accordingly.
//
// That posture had one gap: it covered the operator and never the holder.
//
// §C2b's challenge window is where the gap bites. A claimant who signed her
// holding away and then redeems the last witnessed snapshot has signed **two
// operations at one point in her own nonce sequence**, and the protocol cannot
// tell which of them her dark operator accepted — the evidence for that went
// dark with it. So it cannot always pay the right party. What it can always do
// is name the fault, and these are the predicates that do it:
//
//   - `equivocatingSigner` — one key authorised two operations at one nonce.
//     The holder's fault, and the one that was missing.
//   - `isDoubleAcceptance` — an operator co-signed both halves of that. Under
//     §C2's backer-run default the operator key is the backer's, so this names
//     the party that owes the money.
//   - `isDoublePosition` — an operator co-signed two receipts that cannot both
//     describe one append-only log: two operations at one position, or one
//     operation at two. Either way one of its receipts is a lie about its own log.
//   - `isRewrittenHistory` — an operator committed a log that takes back one it
//     had already committed. An append-only log may grow and may not shrink, and
//     no committed entry may change. This is what restoring from stale data and
//     carrying on produces, and it is the fault ACROSS sequences where
//     isEquivocation is the fault at one.
//
// A fourth reading lives beside the receipt rather than here, because most of
// its answers are ordinary rather than faults: `receiptStatus` (receipt.ts)
// tells a payee whether a committed log holds their operation, has not reached
// it yet, holds something else, or carries nothing for the backing at all. Only
// "holds something else" is this file's business; naming it again there would be
// a second name for one thing.
//
// The two operator faults also catch a **botched failover**: two live servers
// holding one operator key, with no leader election between them, produce
// exactly these artefacts. The protocol cannot distinguish that from malice and
// does not try, which is the same standard it already applies to a self-framing
// commitment equivocation — see CLAUDE.md on the one-writer obligation, and on
// why a threshold construction prevents this rather than merely recording it.
//
// **The signer is derived, never asserted.** A caller who could name the signer
// could choose who is at fault, so the signer comes from the law's own rule
// (`signerFromTerms`, ledger.ts) and the signature has to verify under it. The
// price is that a release or a withdrawal cannot be proved by this pair alone:
// the law reads their signer from the demand they name, which is not in the
// operation. They need that demand too, which is a different function's job.
//
// Verifiers, all of them: the bytes come from whoever is exhibiting them, so
// anything malformed is a fault that is not proven rather than a throw.

 * and equally the artefact of a quiet rewrite, where the log grows but an

 * **Which state came first is derived, never taken from the argument order.** A

 * a stranger can check today and not tomorrow is no fault proof at all: the
 * remedy for a dropped backing IS replacement, so reading the current operator
 * would erase the proof at the exact moment the holder used it, and let an
 * operator launder its record by arranging its own succession (§15 prices a
 * key's history, so that is worth something).
 *
 * So it is answered from the venue's own record, both halves of which are fixed

 * operator's own count (slice 13) — but the venue refuses a sequence that does

 * the boundary. At or below that sequence is before the handover.
