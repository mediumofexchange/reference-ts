// Closure (invariant 16, §8b).
//
// "The full chain under a requirement is its **closure**. Closures are written
// with a `closure(S)` macro, expanded before hashing, and counts add up where
// paths meet. If *b* relies on *x* and *y*, and each of those relies on *z* at
// 1, then closure({x:1, y:1}) = {x:1, y:1, z:2}. Two units of *z*, because
// presenting at *x* alone would leave *y* without the *z* it needs.
// Multiplicities grow like a matrix power, so wallets cap closure size."
//
// **A macro for writing terms, not a rule about them.** §8b: "Anyone can compute
// closed(b), whether R(b) equals its own closure. An unclosed requirement is
// readable: the backer takes in a set it cannot fully unwind, usually because it
// means to sell it." So an unclosed R is a legal setting rather than a mistake,
// and `makeBacking` stores what it is handed. "Expanded before hashing" means a
// backer who writes closure(S) gets the flat expansion into its terms and the
// name commits to that — never that a later reader re-expands what was written,
// which would make a name a function of who is reading it.
//
// **It needs the targets' own terms**, which are hashes here, so it takes a
// resolver. §C0b is what makes one available: "Published means retrievable by a
// stranger: terms, logs, totals, commitments..." — the same availability the
// trail already assumes.
//
// **The resolver is the untrusted part.** It is asked for a name and can hand
// back anything, so every answer is checked against the name asked for. That
// check is also what makes the walk terminate, and it is why invariant 5 still
// holds — "do not write cycle detection. A reliance cycle would need a hash
// cycle; it cannot be built." With the answer checked, a loop would need one, so
// there is nothing to detect. A resolver that tries is refused for lying, not
// for looping.

/**
 * §8b's `closed(b)`, and it has **three** answers rather than two.
